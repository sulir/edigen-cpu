Edigen CPU
==========

This is an extremely simple CPU emulator plugin for [emuStudio](http://github.com/vbmacher/emuStudio). Its instrucion decoder and disassembler is automatically generated by [Edigen](http://github.com/sulir/edigen).

Currently, it is useful only to prove that Edigen-generated plugins are fully functional and compatible with emuStudio.
